# Automated CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions: Integrating Docker, DevSecOps, and Kubernetes

## Overview
This repository focuses on building an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, integrating Docker, DevSecOps best practices, and Kubernetes for seamless deployment. The pipeline automates code testing, security scanning, containerization, and deployment using Helm charts. It ensures a secure, scalable, and efficient workflow for continuous integration and delivery, making software deployment faster and more reliable.

## Features
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated testing and building of Docker images using GitHub Actions.
- **Security Integration (DevSecOps)**: Security scanning with tools like Trivy and SonarQube.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Deployment to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment.
- **Automated Versioning**: Semantic versioning for Docker images and releases.
- GitOps Workflow: Automated deployments using ArgoCD for declarative Kubernetes management.
  
## Prerequisites
- GitHub account and repository.
- Docker installed on your local machine.
- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, AKS, EKS, or GKE).
- Helm installed for Kubernetes package management.
- ArgoCD installed and configured on your Kubernetes cluster.
- GitHub Secrets configured for:
  - `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
  - `KUBECONFIG` for Kubernetes authentication
  - `REGISTRY_URL` (e.g., Docker Hub or private registry)
  - `HELM_CHART_PATH` for chart location

## CI/CD Workflow
### 1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**
- Runs on every push and pull request.
- Steps:
  1. Check out repository code.
  2. Run linting and unit tests.
  3. Build Docker image.
  4. Scan image for vulnerabilities using Trivy/SonarQube.
  5. Push image to container registry.

### 2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
- Triggers on a successful build in `main` branch.
- Steps:
  1. Fetch Helm charts.
  2. Deploy updated image to Kubernetes.
  3. Sync application state using ArgoCD.
  4. Verify deployment health.

## How to Use
1. **Fork and clone this repository.**
2. **Set up GitHub Secrets** as mentioned in the prerequisites.
3. **Push changes to the main branch** to trigger the pipeline.
4. **Monitor workflow runs** in the GitHub Actions tab.
5. **Verify deployment** on your Kubernetes cluster.
6. Verify deployment on your Kubernetes cluster through ArgoCD UI.

## Conclusion
This setup automates the entire software development lifecycle, integrating security, containerization, and Kubernetes deployment seamlessly with GitOps principles using ArgoCD. Feel free to contribute or customize as per your project needs!
